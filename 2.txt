# Track 2: The Three Norns

Let's begin by recalling what we learned:
The tree is big = Treet er stort
Wisdom is important = Visdom er viktig

Today we'll meet the three Norns who live beneath Yggdrasil: Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld. Their names actually tell us about time - past, present, and future. This is perfect, because today we're learning how to talk about time in Norwegian!

First, let's learn a new verb. "To have" in Norwegian is "å ha". That "å" is like English "to" - it marks what we call the infinitive form. When we actually use the verb, we drop the "å", just like we drop "to" in English.

I have = Jeg har
You have = Du har

Notice how similar "har" is to English "have"? Again, our languages are closely related!

Now, the eldest Norn is Urd, whose name means "what has become" - the past. To talk about the past in Norwegian, we use "var" instead of "er". This is like English changing "is" to "was":

Treet er stort = The tree is big
Treet var stort = The tree was big

Let's practice this pattern:
Urd var gammel = Urd was old
Visdom var viktig = Wisdom was important

The second Norn, Verdandi, represents the present - what is becoming. Her name is actually related to our word "was" (var)! 

Let's learn some time words to help us tell their story:
Now = Nå (sounds like "now"!)
Today = I dag
Yesterday = I går

Try using these in sentences:
Treet er stort nå = The tree is big now
Visdom var viktig i går = Wisdom was important yesterday

The third Norn, Skuld, represents what "should" or must become - the future. In fact, her name is related to English "should"! We'll learn more about the future tense in our next lesson.

For now, let's learn two very important words:
Here = Her
There = Der

These words connect to our story because the Norns are always there (der) beneath the tree, weaving the fates of all beings.

Let's make some new sentences:
The Norns are here = Nornene er her
The wisdom was there = Visdommen var der

Notice how we added -ene to "Norn" to make it plural? This is like adding -s in English. And we used -en (instead of -et) with "visdom" because it's a different type of noun. Don't worry about remembering these patterns yet - just notice them.

Try building these sentences:
1. The Norns were here
2. Wisdom is here now
3. The tree was there yesterday

(Solutions: 1. Nornene var her 2. Visdom er her nå 3. Treet var der i går)

Let's put it all together with part of their story:
Nornene er gamle = The Norns are old
De har visdom = They have wisdom
Visdommen var her = The wisdom was here
Nornene er der nå = The Norns are there now

What we've learned:
- Past tense with "var"
- The verb "to have" (å ha)
- Time expressions (nå, i dag, i går)
- Location words (her, der)
- More about -en/-et endings
- Plural endings with -ene

Each sentence you make is weaving together your knowledge of Norwegian, just as the Norns weave together the fates of all beings beneath Yggdrasil's mighty branches.

Next time, we'll learn about Thor's hammer Mjolnir, and through its story, we'll discover how to express possession and describe things in more detail in Norwegian!

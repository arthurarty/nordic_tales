# Track 1: The World Tree

Welcome to Norwegian! Before we begin building sentences, let's talk about how English and Norwegian are deeply connected. They're both Germanic languages, and that means they share many words and patterns. You'll be surprised how much Norwegian you already know!

Let's start with something you might have heard of - Yggdrasil, the great world tree of Norse mythology. This tree connects all the nine worlds, and through it, we'll connect our first Norwegian words.

The word "is" in Norwegian is "er" - almost identical to English, just dropping the 'i'. You'll notice this happens often; English and Norwegian words are like siblings who dress slightly differently.

Try this: The tree is = Treet er

Did you notice that "tree" becomes "treet"? That -et ending is like English "the". Instead of saying "the tree", Norwegian adds -et to the end of the word. We'll come back to this pattern later.

Now, in Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is enormous. To say something is enormous in Norwegian, we can use "stor" (meaning big/large). Listen to how similar it is to English "store" - they share the same ancient root meaning something substantial.

Let's build our first complete sentence:
Yggdrasil er stor = Yggdrasil is big

Try another one:
Treet er stort = The tree is big

(Notice how "stor" became "stort" - this is because "tree" in Norwegian is neuter gender. Don't worry about remembering this yet; we'll explore it naturally as we go along.)

In the mythology, beneath Yggdrasil's roots lies a well of wisdom guarded by Mimir. The Norse word for wisdom was "visdom" - exactly the same as English "wisdom"! Even after a thousand years, some words have barely changed.

Let's make another sentence:
Visdom er viktig = Wisdom is important

Can you guess what "viktig" means? Yes, it's related to English "vital" and "important". You're already understanding Norwegian words through their connection to English!

Now, let's put it all together with the story:
Yggdrasil er stort = Yggdrasil is big
Treet er viktig = The tree is important
Visdom er gammel = Wisdom is ancient
("gammel" sounds a bit like "gamma" - think of something from ancient times!)

Practice building these sentences. Notice how each one follows the same pattern:
[Thing] + er + [description]

Remember:
- "er" = is
- -et ending = the
- Many Norwegian words are similar to English
- Word order often matches English

In just this first lesson, you've learned how to:
- Say what things are
- Use "the" with nouns
- Make basic statements
- Recognize cognates (shared words) between English and Norwegian

Next time, we'll learn about the three Norns who dwell by Yggdrasil's roots, and through their story, we'll discover how to talk about past, present, and future in Norwegian.

Want to test yourself? Try making these sentences in Norwegian:
1. The wisdom is old
2. Yggdrasil is important
3. The tree is ancient

(Solutions: 1. Visdommen er gammel 2. Yggdrasil er viktig 3. Treet er gammelt)

Notice how we used simple patterns to tell part of an ancient story. Each Norwegian sentence you make is connecting you not just to a new language, but to thousands of years of Norse culture and mythology.

Next lesson, we'll learn how the Norns weave the fates of gods and humans, and through their story, we'll weave together more elements of Norwegian grammar!

# Track 3: Thor's Hammer

Remember how we talked about the Norns yesterday? We learned:
The Norns were here = Nornene var her
They have wisdom = De har visdom

Today we'll learn about Thor's mighty hammer, Mjolnir. And through this legendary weapon, we'll discover how Norwegian shows who owns what!

In English, we show possession with 's (Thor's hammer). In Norwegian, we have a similar pattern, but we use an -s without the apostrophe:
Thor's hammer = Thors hammer
The tree's roots = Treets røtter

Let's learn some useful words to describe Mjolnir:
Strong = Sterk
Heavy = Tung
Magical = Magisk

Notice how "magisk" sounds just like "magic" with a slight change? Many words describing powerful things are similar between our languages because of our shared Viking heritage!

Now, in Norwegian, when we describe things, our adjectives sometimes need to change to match the noun. Remember how "stor" (big) became "stort" with "tree" (treet)? Let's explore this pattern:

Hammeren er tung = The hammer is heavy
Mjolnir er magisk = Mjolnir is magical
Treet er stort = The tree is big

Here's something interesting - when we put these describing words before the noun, they change slightly:
En tung hammer = A heavy hammer
Et stort tre = A big tree
Den magiske hammeren = The magical hammer

Don't worry about memorizing these patterns - just notice them for now. They'll become natural as we practice.

Let's learn three more useful words:
Good = God
Small = Liten
New = Ny

Try making some sentences:
Thor er sterk = Thor is strong
Hammeren er god = The hammer is good
Den lille hammeren = The small hammer

In the mythology, Thor's hammer always returns to him when thrown. Let's learn how to say "to return" - "å komme tilbake":
Hammeren kommer tilbake = The hammer returns

Notice how "kommer" looks like English "come"? Many action words are similar between our languages!

Let's put it all together with part of Mjolnir's story:
Thors hammer er magisk = Thor's hammer is magical
Den er sterk og tung = It is strong and heavy
Hammeren kommer tilbake = The hammer returns
Den lille hammeren er god = The small hammer is good

Did you notice we used "og" for "and"? It sounds just like "og" in "fog" - easy to remember!

Try building these sentences:
1. The magical hammer was here
2. Thor's tree is big
3. The small hammer returns
4. The hammer is good now

(Solutions: 1. Den magiske hammeren var her 2. Thors tre er stort 3. Den lille hammeren kommer tilbake 4. Hammeren er god nå)

What we've learned today:
- How to show possession with -s
- Adjective agreement patterns
- New descriptive words
- How to say "and" (og)
- The verb "to return" (å komme tilbake)

Remember:
- Many adjectives change to match their nouns
- Possession works similarly to English
- Word order usually follows English patterns
- Look for similarities between the languages

Through Mjolnir's power, you've gained the ability to describe things in more detail in Norwegian! Next time, we'll learn about Odin's ravens, Hugin and Munin, and through their story, we'll discover how to talk about actions and movement in Norwegian!

Practice making sentences about things that are magical, strong, or heavy. Each sentence strengthens your connection to both the language and the ancient tales of the Norse gods!
